# Multiple string find/replace in files

[![build-test](https://github.com/flcdrg/replace-multiple-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flcdrg/replace-multiple-action/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This action searches matching files for strings and replaces any matches with replacement values, then saves the modified file(s).

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: flcdrg/replace-multiple-action@v2
        with:
          files: './*.md'
          find: '[{ "find": "Multiple", "replace": "Many" }]'
```

### Example updating links in Markdown

Search for Markdown files in the current directory. In each matching file, search for Markdown links. eg. that start the line, have whitespace or a left bracket preceding them, and have an end of line, whitespace or right bracket immediately after them.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: flcdrg/replace-multiple-action@v2
    with:
        files: './*.md'
        find: '[{ "find": "http://localhost", "replace": "https://localhost"}, { "find": "http://davidgardiner.net.au", "replace": "https://david.gardiner.net.au" }]'
        prefix: '(^|\\s+|\\()'
        suffix: '($|\\s+|\\))'
```

### Example with Wayback machine action

The `replacements` output from the [`flcdrg/wayback-machine-query-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/wayback-machine-query) action is the correct shape to be passed in to the `find` input for this action.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Wayback Machine Query
    uses: flcdrg/wayback-machine-query-action@v2
    id: wayback
    with:
        source-path: ./lychee/links.json
        timestamp-regex: '_posts\/(\d+)\/(?<year>\d+)-(?<month>\d+)-(?<day>\d+)-'
        
  - name: Replacements
    uses: flcdrg/replace-multiple-action@v2
    with:
        find: ${{ steps.wayback.outputs.replacements }}
        prefix: '(^|\\s+|\\()'
        suffix: '($|\\s+|\\))'
```

## Inputs

Various inputs are defined in [`action.yml`](action.yml) to let you configure this action:

| Name | Description | Default |
| - | - | - |
| `files` | A wildcard glob used to match files that should be searched | `**/*.md` |
| `find` | A JSON array of strings to find and values to replace. The JSON array should conform to this structure. `{ find: string; replace: string; }[]`  | |
| `prefix` | (optional) Part of a regular expression that is prepended to the search string to add additional context on when to match the string. The matched value of this regular expression group also prepended to the replacement value. | |
| `suffix` | (optional) Part of a regular expression that is appended to the search string to add additional context on when to match the string. The matched value of this regular expression group is also appended to the replacement value. | |
